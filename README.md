### I'm Pride

I'm a computer and data science and biology student studying software development and computational biology/bioinformatics and working in research on developing a predictive machine learning model
based on LLM image classification to predict plant genera. I also get involved in genomics, proteomics, evolutionary biology, botany, and ecological and atmospheric sciences.
Secretly (not really🤭), I'm more skillful at software and full stack development.

I'm otherwise writing screenplay and doing filmmaking stuff, stargazing, storm watching, cooking, watching movies or sleeping.

You might find me watching a lot of films because that's probably where I would've ended up if I hadn't touched a computer. That is Bilal Hasna on my profile picture.
