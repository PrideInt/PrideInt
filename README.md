### I'm Pride

I'm a student studying computer and data science in computational biology/bioinformatics. I also really like ecological and atmospheric sciences. NYC HIVE!!

You may find me watching a lot of films because that's probably where I would've ended up if I hadn't touched a computer. That is Stewy Hosseini (Arian Moayed) on my profile picture (in Oscar Isaac we trust).

Developer for @ProjectKorra.
