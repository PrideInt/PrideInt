### I'm Pride

I'm a student studying computer and data science and biology in computational biology/bioinformatics. I also really like ecological and atmospheric sciences. I do machine learning stuff, full stack stuff, research stuff, proteomics stuff, flower stuff, filmmaking stuff, screenplay stuff, cooking stuff, storm stuff. NYC HIVE!!

You might find me watching a lot of films because that's probably where I would've ended up if I hadn't touched a computer. That is Alec Secareanu on my profile picture (in Oscar Isaac we trust).
